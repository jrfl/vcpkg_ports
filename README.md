# vcpkg_ports

Some ports I'm working on for vcpkg (https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)

I am not interested in signing a bunch of Microsoft legal crap (their CLA) in order to contribute to their repositories, so I am storing what work I do on the ports here.

Vcpkg seems to be *very* quirky at this point so I imagine once Microsoft has what they consider a release quality build these will have to be revisited.

## Note to Microsoft...
You guys are free to do anything you like with the files in this repository.  If you need the license changed or anything like that let me know.  However, I am not willing to sign any document from Microsoft.  Period.  In the very unlikely event that Microsoft wants to pay a counsel of my choosing, I may consider signing something.  No, I'm not a crank.  I learn from my mistakes.
