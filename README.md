# vcpkg_ports

Some ports I'm working on for vcpkg (https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)

I am not interested in signing a bunch of Microsoft legal crap (their CLA) in order to contribute to their repositories, so I am storing what work I do on the ports here.

Vcpkg seems to be *very* quirky at this point so I imagine once Microsoft has what they consider a release quality build these will have to be revisited.
